Before creating the website we first had a meeting with the team to discuss which features we would like to have in it.  
After that I created the first draft of the design, mainly just to house the newsletter feature.
I also created a design system with reusable elements like inputs, buttons, headings, etc.

Later that design got improved and changed into the version it is today, with the added parallax view of the city and the developer blog section.

The website is made with the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework and saves the blog posts as markdown files on the server locally.
