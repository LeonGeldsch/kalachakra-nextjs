Hello! My name is Felix Koköfer and I am responsible for a big part of the music you hear in the game.  
For production, I tried to implement as much of my influences from underground electronic music.

Therefor I used a variety of synthesizer and some unique processing chains.  
I created some dark and light musical bits for contrast and tried to unite organic style with clean digital sound design in every track.  
I hope you enjoy it!
