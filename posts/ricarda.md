From thumbnails to the finished illustration, this blog will give you a small insight on how we designed our characters.

The first step was to get a feel for the character and to decide on how she would present herself. thumbnails are very helpful to get to a silhouette that fits the mental image of the character. We really liked the idea of an oversized jacket on a petite girl.

After we found a base that felt right, the iteration process began. Here you can see various outfits and hairstyles. With some feedback from the group and small tweeks, we had our Hana concept.

With the help of the character sheet above, I created an illustration for the dialogue screen of the game. For these we wanted to have a cell shaded look with a gloomy feel to it and a little pink shine from the neon lights.

And that's the finished result!

I hoped you enjoyed following our little journey on finding the perfect look for our main character.
